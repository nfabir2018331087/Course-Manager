# Course Manager
Course Manager is a **web application** that is built to manage the academic system of an institute. It is built with **JSP** and **Servlet** which works on **Java** language. For frontend design, **Tailwind CSS** is used. For databases, we have used **MySQL**.
It was developed as a project work for our Web Technology course.
